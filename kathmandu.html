            Kathmandu, the largest city of Nepal, is the political as well as cultural capital of the country. Kathmandu is a city where ancient traditions rub shoulders with the latest technological advances. However, it is the grandeur of the past that enchants the visitor whose gaze may linger on an exquisitely carved wooden window frame, an 18th century bronze sculpture or the spiritually uplifting stupas. Like any big city, Kathmandu has seen rapid expansion in the last decade, but despite the hustle and bustle so typical of metropolitan cities, its people remain as refreshingly friendly as ever. Retaining its ancient traditions, Kathmandu is blessed by a Living Goddess and is enriched by endless ceremonial processions and events that take to the streets every now and then with throngs of devotees seeking blessings. These religious festivals are steeped in legend and are quite a spectacle with chariot processions and masked dancers often possessed by the spirits of deities.

            <h2> Places to visit in Kathmandu and things to do </h2>
            <h3>1. Boudhanath Stupa </h3>
            <p class="nepal-text">
              Kathmandu’s skyline is dominated by the Boudhanath Stupa, located approximately 11 kilometres away from the city centre. There are thousands of pilgrims here every day from a variety of religious backgrounds. They circumnavigate the large dome known as the ‘kora’ in a ritualistic way. In order to receive good karma, one must circumambulate the stupa without any malice in their heart.<br><br>

              This majestic stupa has the largest mandala in Nepal and the entire continent. A UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1979, Boudhanath Stupa is one of the most visited Buddhist sites in the world. Kassapa Buddha’s ashes are believed to be buried in this stupa.
            </p>

            <h3>2. Pashupatinath Temple </h3>
            <p class="nepal-text">
              Located on the eastern edge of Kathmandu, Pashupatinath Temple stretches across both banks of the Bagmati River. Thousands of devotees seek blessings from Lord Shiva in the magnificent sanctum dedicated to him. Temples and ashrams dot the area surrounding the Pashupatinath temple, which houses a Jyotirlinga believed to be the head of the body of the twelve Jyotirlinga located across India. UNESCO recognised the temple as a World Heritage Site in 1979.
